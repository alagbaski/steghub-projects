### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Setup

1. **Request a Public Certificate:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager service.
   - Request a new public SSL/TLS certificate for your domain (e.g., `*.yourdomain.com`).
   - Choose DNS validation as the validation method.

2. **Validate Your Domain Ownership:**
   - ACM will provide a CNAME record that you need to add to your DNS provider (e.g., Route 53) to prove domain ownership.
   - Once the CNAME record has been created successfully in the Route 53 hosted zone, we will need to configure the CNAME record in the `Cloudns.net` domain. This step will validate and issue the certificate.

1. **Create an EFS for Shared File Storage:**
   - Navigate to the Amazon EFS service and create a new file system.
   - Configure it to be accessible by both Nginx and web server instances.

2. **Set Up Mount Targets in Each Subnet:**
   - Ensure you create mount targets for EFS in each subnet that houses an EC2 instance.

3. **Create EFS Access Points:**
   - This will specify where the webservers will mount with, thus creating 2 mount points for `Tooling` and `Wordpress` servers each.
     
     **Output 1:**
     ![EFS](./images/create-efs-01.PNG)

### Configure Application Load Balancers (ALB)

> Note: Before creating the ALBs, we have to create the target groups first, you can find guidelines on how to do this in the `Setting Up Compute Resources Section`.

![List-TG](./images/target-groups-created.PNG)

1. **Create an Internet-Facing ALB:**
   - Configure the ALB to listen on the HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443).
   - Choose the appropriate VPC, AZ, and subnets for the ALB.
   - Select the TLS certificate from ACM.
   - Assign the correct security group to the ALB.
   - Configure the ALB with the Nginx target group.
     
     **Output 1:**
     ![ALB](./images/create-ALB-01.PNG)

     **Output 2:**
     ![ALB](./images/create-ALB-02.PNG)

     **Output 3:**
     ![ALB](./images/create-ALB-03.PNG)

     **Output 4:**
     ![ALB](./images/create-ALB-04.PNG)

     **Output 5:**
     ![ALB](./images/create-ALB-05.PNG)

2. **Create an Internal ALB for Web Servers:**
   - Set the ALB to listen on HTTPS (TCP port 443).
   - Choose the appropriate VPC, AZ, and subnets for the ALB.
   - Select the TLS certificate from ACM.
   - Assign the correct security group to the ALB.
   - Use the appropriate target group for routing traffic to the web servers, in this case we have the `Wordpress` target group and `Tooling` target group.
    
     **Output:**
     ![ALB-List](./images/list-ALB.PNG)
   
   > Note: The default target group configured on the listener while creating the internal load balancer is to forward traffic to `Wordpress` on port 443. Hence, we need to create a rule to route traffic to `Tooling` as well.

   - Choose the load balancer where you want to add the rule.
   - Listeners Tab:
     - Click on the Listeners tab.
     - Select the listener (HTTPS:443) and click `Manage listener`.
   - Click on Add rule.
   - Configure the Rule:
     - Give the rule a name and click next.
     - Add a condition by selecting `Host header`.
     - Enter the hostnames for which you want to route traffic. (e.g. `tooling.com` and `www.tooling.com`).
     - Choose the appropriate target group for the hostname.
       
       **Output 1:**
       ![ALB-Rule](./images/add-tooling-rule.PNG)

       **Output 2:**

       ![Webserver-Self-CRT](./images/self-assigned-crt-webserver.PNG)

3. **Create an AMI from the Web Server Instance:**
   - After installing the necessary software, create an AMI from the web server instance, just like we did for Nginx and Bastion.

4. **Prepare Launch Templates for Web Servers:**
   - Use the created AMI to set up separate launch templates for WordPress and Tooling web servers.
   - Ensure instances are launched in private subnets and assign the appropriate security group.
   - Configure user data to update the yum package repository and install `WordPress` (only for WordPress launch template). Also for Tooling configure the user data to clone the `Tooling` code repository and carry out the necessary configurations to deploy the Tooling website.
   
   > Link to both user data can be found in this [link](https://github.com/alagbaski/devtank_user_data_config/tree/main).

5. **Configure Target Groups for Web Servers:**
   - Set the target type as "Instances".
   - Use the HTTPS protocol on the secure TLS port (443).
   - Set the health check path to `/healthstatus` and register the Web Server instances as targets.

   - Set scaling policies to scale out if CPU utilization reaches 90%.
   - Set up an SNS topic to receive scaling notifications.

### Configure DNS with Route 53

- **Create DNS Records for Services:**

    Earlier in this project we registered a free domain with `Cloudns` and configured a hosted zone in `Route53`. But that is not all that needs to be done as far as DNS configuration is concerned.

    We need to ensure that the main domain for the `WordPress` website can be reached, and the subdomain for `Tooling` website can also be reached using a browser.
     
     - Create an alias record for the root domain and direct its traffic to the ALB DNS name.
