### What is (SDLC)?
SDLC simplify means Software Development Life Cycle, SDLC is a methodology used by software development teams to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It provides a structured framework for managing the entire software development process from inception to delivery.

### Types of (SDLC) modules:
Each model has its own set of characteristics, advantages, and limitations, and the choice depends on project requirements and organizationâ€™s preferences:
- **Waterfall Model:** This is a sequential, linear approach to software development, it is divided into distinct phases and progression to the next phase only occurs after completion of the previous phase.
- **Spiral Model:** This is an iterative and incremental approach, it is risk-driven, with a focus on identifying and mitigating risks early in the process.
- **Agile Model:** This approach focuses on delivering working software in short iterations and also collaboration and customer involvement are emphasized throughout the development process.
- **Iterative Model:** Similar to the Agile model, but with less emphasis on customer collaboration and more focus on iterative and incremental development.
- **V-Model:** This is an extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes the relationship between each development stage and its corresponding testing stage.

### Importance of (SDLC):
SDLC provides a structured  approach to software development, ensuring that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and with the expected quality of products. It also helps manage risks, control costs, and improve collaboration among teams.

### Different Stages of SDLC:
- **Planning:** During this stage, project objectives, requirements, and constraints are identified. Teams collaborate to define project scope, budget, and timelines.
- **Analysis:** Requirements gathering is performed to understand the needs of end-users and stakeholders. Requirements are analyzed for feasibility, clarity, and completeness.
- **Design:** System architecture, data models, user interfaces, and other technical specifications are developed. Design documents serve as blueprints for implementation.
- **Implementation:** Developers write code based on the design specifications. Unit testing and integration testing are conducted to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Testing:** The software is tested against predefined test cases to identify defects and ensure that it meets the specified requirements. Testing includes functional, performance, and security testing.
- **Deployment:** The software is deployed to production environments or released to end-users. Installation, configuration, and data migration may be performed during this phase.
- **Maintenance:** After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements are made to address issues and improve performance.

### Conclusion:
The Software Development Life Cycle is a critical framework for developing high-quality software. By following a systematic process and leveraging appropriate best practices organizations can improve efficiency, reduce risks, and deliver successful software solutions.

## What is"LAMP"?
"LAMP" is an acronym that stands for:
- L = Linux : This is an operating system, it provides the underlying infrastructure and resources needed to run web applications.
- A = Apache: This is an open-source web server software, it's responsible for serving web pages to users browsers when they request them.
- M = MySQL: This is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing data.
- P = PHP: This is a server-side scripting language used for developing dynamic web applications, it's embedded within HTML code and executed on the web server to generate dynamic content. 

The LAMP stack provides a powerful and flexible platform for building and deploying web applications.

## Understanding 'chmod' & 'chown' commands:
- **'chmod':** The 'chmod' command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. This permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file, and they are represented by three sets of characters namely user permissions, group permissions, and others permissions.

- **'chown':** The 'chown' command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory. Ownership includes both the user owner and the group owner of the file or directory.

File and directory permissions consist of three sets of characters namely; 
- **User Permissions (u):** These permissions apply to the owner of the file or directory.
- **Group Permissions (g):** These permissions apply to the group owner of the file or directory.
- **Others Permissions (o):** These permissions apply to all users who are not the owner or members of the group.

And each set of permissions (u, g, o) consists of three characters:
- 'r' = 4 (Read): Allows reading of the file or directory contents.
- 'w' = 2 (Write): Allows writing to the file or directory, including creating, deleting, or modifying files.
- 'x' = 1 (Execute): Allows executing the file (for files) or accessing the directory (for directories).
- '-' (denoting no permission).

## Difference between TCP & UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both protocols used for sending data over the Internet, but they have different characteristics.

- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means it establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. It ensures that all data packets are delivered in the correct order and without errors. It's commonly used for applications that require reliable and ordered delivery of data, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer.
- UDP is a connectionless protocol. And it does not establish a connection between the sender and recevier before sending data and does not provide mechanisms for ensuring reliable delivery or ordering of packets. It is often used for real-time applications where a small amount of packet loss is acceptable, such as video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).

So in summary, TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, while UDP offers low-latency, connectionless communication with no guarantees of delivery or order.

Examples of ports commonly used in Web:
- http = 80
- https = 443
- ssh = 22
- telnet = 23
- ftp = 21
- sftp = Default port is 22 but to aviod conflicts with ssh port, admins often choose ports above 1024

## Vi & Vim Text Editor
- **Vi:** (Vi) stands for Visual Editor. It's one of the oldest and most basic text editors available on Unix systems. Vi has two modes:
  1. **Command mode:** In this mode, keystrokes are interpreted as commands rather than text input. You can navigate the document, delete lines, copy and paste text, and perform other editing operations using commands.
  2. **Insert mode:** In this mode, you can directly input and edit text. You switch to insert mode from command mode by pressing the "i" key. To return to command mode, press the "Esc" key.

- **Vim:** (Vim) stands for Vi IMproved. It's an enhanced version of Vi with additional features and improvements. Vim retains the two modes of Vi (command and insert) but adds many new features, such as syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, multiple buffers, and plugins.Vim is highly customizable and extensible, allowing users to tailor it to their specific needs. It's popular among developers and system administrators for its power and efficiency once mastered.

Both Vi and Vim are modal editors, meaning they have different modes for entering and executing commands and for inserting and editing text. This modal approach can be initially confusing for new users but offers efficient editing workflows once mastered.
